# Tune-O-Matic
Tuner for analog synths, inspired by Amanda Ghassaei's Instructables and Sam's LookMumNoComputer Videos

This code is an adapter version of the code published by Amanda and Sam. I streamlined the code a bit
and added some comments. I came across the tune while looking at Sam's video on the 1112 performance 
oscillators and responded to his challenge for anyone to look at the code and maybe send him a
new version.

Have a look at LOOKMUMNOCOMPUTER's video's on building the 
1112 performance oscillators here https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/projects#/1222-performance-vco 

Note, the code contains one define LED_TEST which you can use to test your hardware.
When uncommented and uploaded it allows you to check all the leds and the patterns used to 
show the tuning in the display. Once you are sure the leds perform as they should, comment the line,
recompile and upload the code and you should be set.
